# Machine Learning with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various Machine Learning (ML) techniques and examples using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The notebooks demonstrate how to use these libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.

## Contents

- NumPy Examples: Basic operations and techniques using NumPy arrays, matrix manipulations, and mathematical functions.
- Pandas Examples: Working with DataFrames, data cleaning, filtering, and manipulation using Pandas.
- Scikit-learn Examples: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering using Scikit-learn.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)
- seaborn (optional, for better plots)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
